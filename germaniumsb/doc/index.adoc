= Germanium Selector Builder 1.0.0

A simple yet powerful program to help you write Selenium selectors from
GermaniumHQ.

== Introduction

Selenium works with selectors to find the elements that the test will interact
with. For example to interact with the google search, after opening the
browser, to fetch the input element to type in a search something like this is
needed:

*Python Sample*

[source,python]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
wd.findElement(By.css(""))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to find such elements, usually it's needed to inspect the internal
structure of the page using the developer tools. It's the responsibility of the
test creator to then determine the correct `CSS` or `XPath` selector that will
be used, to uniquely identify that element.

This is a tedious and error prone task, since even simple misspelling can cause
a lot of wasted time in trying to figure out why the selector isn't matching
the elements.

That's why the Germanium Selector Builder (`GermaniumSB` from here) was
written. In `GermaniumSB` you point your mouse to the element you want a
selector for, and you click it.  The selector gets automatically written.

Then the selector can be copied into the test.

== Usage

When opening `GermaniumSB` a window opens that allows code editing. In the code
section is where the editing of the selectors, commenting them, or highlighting
them for troubleshooting will take place.
